## How-To

In this prototype, I have collected some problems and troubleshooting with LC-MS/MS or HPLC from online sources, such as websites and webinars for demonstration purpose.  

The causes of each problem were categorized in a Cause and Effect diagram.  The category is designed to reflect the parts of analysis system so that the diagram can be used as a guide to break down the system for the drill-down investigation.  Each cause is elaborated by clicking item. Below is a screenshot.
