## Symptom
<div class = "row">
<img width ="360" height= "200" src = "/docs/images/Screenshot 2022-08-16 144949.png" style ="float: left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"/>  
<figure>This is a peptide mixture that was run for as part of a system suitability tests.  Peaks responses on day 2 were less than those on day 1.</figure> 
</div>

## Root Causes
**1. Gas flow is low**  
<img width ="720" height= "400" src = "/docs/images/Screenshot 2022-08-16 145126.png" style ="float: left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"/>  
<figure> The pressure readings on the top are different. The right is lower than the left.

**2. The ESI probe adjustment**

Maybe a millimeter and a half and this is barely protruding at all. We're getting barely protruding on whistle blow sensitive this is `the low sensitivity`. So this is not properly adjusted for this simply configuration. And nebulization is not as effective.
