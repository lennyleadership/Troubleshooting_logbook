This is the prototype of a digitized troubleshooting logbook.  

The purposes of the digitized troubleshooting logbook are to:  
1) Collect problems and solutions.  
2) Learn from lessons.  
3) Build troubleshooting skills from legacy.  
4) Search keywords and look up solutions from previous experience.  
5) Provide materials for training purpose.

I have collected some problems with LC-MS/MS or HPLC from online sources, such as websites and webinars for demonstration purpose.  An offline troubleshooting logbook will be implemented.
