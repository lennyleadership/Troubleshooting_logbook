This is the prototype of a digitized troubleshooting logbook.  

The purpose of the digitized troubleshooting logbook is to:  
1) Collect problems and solutions.
2) Search keywords and look up solutions from previous experience.

I have collected some problems with LC-MS/MS or HPLC from online sources, such as websites and webinars for demonstration purpose.
