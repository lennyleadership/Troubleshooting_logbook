The idea of developing an electronic troubleshooting logbook prototype came from my experience with the practice at LifeLabs (Burnaby, BC) where we wrote down troubleshooting on paper, then scanned the hard copy to pdf and stored away on a server.  

This electronic troubleshooting logbook prototype is HTML-based, rather than SQL-based.  

It is my attempt to digitize troubleshooting records without IT efforts and without implementing database in the laboratory business.  

The advantage of such approach is that it can take screenshots or images of scanned documents.  It is more advanced than SQL database approach. 

The purposes of digitizing troubleshooting logbook go beyond a conventional logbook. It could 1) search keywords and look up solutions from previous experience legacy.  
2) control versions to comply with requirements of quality management.

In this prototype, I have collected some problems and troubleshooting with LC-MS/MS or HPLC from online sources, such as websites and webinars for demonstration purpose.  An offline troubleshooting logbook is an option.
