The idea of developing a digitized troubleshooting logbook prototype came from my experience at LifeLabs (Burnaby).  

The purposes of the digitized troubleshooting logbook are to:  
1) Collect problems and solutions.  
2) Learn from lessons.  
3) Build troubleshooting skills from legacy.  
4) Search keywords and look up solutions from previous experience.  
5) Be proactive in maintenance and troubleshooting.
6) Provide materials for training purpose.

I have collected some problems with LC-MS/MS or HPLC from online sources, such as websites and webinars for demonstration purpose.  An offline troubleshooting logbook will be available.
