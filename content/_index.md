This is an electronic troubleshooting logbook prototype for the laboratory setting.  The idea of developing it came from my experience with the practice at LifeLabs (Burnaby, BC) where we wrote down troubleshooting on paper, then scanned the hard copy to pdf and stored away on a server. There is a fleet of over 10 LC-MS/MS instruments in operations.  Many of troubleshooting records were generated. It is my attempt to address the efficiency of searching problems and solutions among records.

This electronic troubleshooting logbook prototype would be considered as a database, however it is not built with SQL, but a HTML-based tool.  One reason behind it is: It is such a small project that the organization IT group would not have time for it; and a lab scientist would not have skills in building a SQL database, especially handling screenshot or images with SQL database.

There are two advantages of taking the HTML-based approach: 1) There is a feature of category and tag.  Each problem and solution can be labeled under different categories and tags. As a result, problems and solutions can be sorted for statistical analysis or trending purpose. 2) There is a feature of version control.  Every change is tracked to comply with the requirements of quality management.

With regards to the security concern, such electronic logbook can be built at a local computer or a local server.
