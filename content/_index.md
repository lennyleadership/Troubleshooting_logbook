This is an electronic troubleshooting logbook prototype.  The idea of developing it came from my experience with the practice at LifeLabs (Burnaby, BC) where we wrote down troubleshooting on paper, then scanned the hard copy to pdf and stored away on a server. There is a fleet of over 10 LC-MS/MS instruments in operations.  Many of troubleshooting records were generated. It is my attempt to address the efficiency of searching problems and solutions among records.

This electronic troubleshooting logbook prototype is HTML-based, rather than SQL-based.  One reason behind it is: It is a small project that the lab would not get much support from the organization IT group.  A lab scientist would not have skill in building a SQL database, especially handling screenshot or images with SQL database.  However, because this prototype has features of categories and tags,  the problems and solutions are organized. Therefore they can be sorted. 

An online and an offline option are doable, but I prefer the online option because the revision can be controlled to comply with requirements of quality management by incorporating with [GitHub for enterprises](https://github.com/enterprise?ef_id=a3551c9ee71d1c9b2bba7f96e74a429f:G:s&OCID=AID2202671_SEM_a3551c9ee71d1c9b2bba7f96e74a429f:G:s&msclkid=a3551c9ee71d1c9b2bba7f96e74a429f) which is owned and operated by Microsoft. Therefore the data security is achievable.
